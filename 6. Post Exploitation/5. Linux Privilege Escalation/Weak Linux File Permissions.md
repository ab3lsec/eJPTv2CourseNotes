# Writeable Shadow FIle

Having write permissions to `/etc/shadow` as a normal user is also extremely dangerous!!<br>
As an attacker if we gain the shell of a normal user, and if he have write access to `/etc/shadow` file. Then he can edit the file and add his new password hash in the place of root user.

1. Create a new password hash : 
```bash
mkpasswd -m sha-512 [NEW PASSWORD]

openssl passwd [NEW PASSWORD]
```

2. Since we have write permission, we can use a text editor like VIM/nano to edit the `/etc/shadow` file and replace the current hash with new password hash.

3. After editing `/etc/shadow` we can use the new password that we created and use it switch to root user.

```bash
su root
```
