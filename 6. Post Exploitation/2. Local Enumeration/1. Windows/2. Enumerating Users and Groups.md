# Enumerating Windows Users and Groups

After gaining access to a system, it's always important to learn more about the system. What users access it? What account am I in control of?
- Current user and privileges
- Additional user information
- Other users on the system
- Groups
- Member of the built-in administrators group

#### USER ENUMERATION:

```c
C:\> net user
C:\> net user /DOMAIN
# enumerate all local users and domain users

C:\> net user [USERNAME]
# get more info on [USERNAME]

C:\> whoami /priv
# enumerate user privileges

C:\> whoami /all
# list username and more info

C:\> echo %USERNAME%
# same as whoami but for older systems

C:\> query user
# enumerate logged on users
```

#### GROUP ENUMERATION:

```c
C:\> net localgroup
# Enumerate local groups on a system

C:\> net localgroup [GROUP NAME]
# Enumerate the members of group
```

#### METASPLOIT MODULES:

```
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
