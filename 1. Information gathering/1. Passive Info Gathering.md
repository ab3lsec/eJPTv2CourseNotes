- Subdomain Hunting

#### WEB RECON:

- Gathering information using `host` command:
```
host <DOMAIN NAME>
```
- Analysing contents of `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` files
- Builtwith.com (https://builtwith.com/) : is a firefox add-on used to identifying the technologies used for building the website like frameworks, CDN, Analytics etc..
- Wappalyzer : alternative to Builtwith.

- `dnsrecon` : is a tool which lists the values of DNS records like A,AAAA, SOA, MX, NS of the given target domain. 
```sh
dnsrecon -d <DOMAIN NAME>
```

- DNSdumpter.com (https://dnsdumpster.com): is a website which is a more effective alternative to dnsrecon. It provides addition details like Subdomains under the target. and also provide a graphical view mapping of the target.
