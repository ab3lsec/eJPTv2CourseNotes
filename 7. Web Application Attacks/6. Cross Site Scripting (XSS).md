# Cross Site Scripting using XSSer

#### WHAT IS XSS?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

#### XXSer TOOL

Cross Site "Scripter" (aka XSSer) is an automatic -framework- to detect, exploit and report XSS vulnerabilities in web-based applications.<br>
It provides several options to try to bypass certain filters and various special techniques for code injection.
