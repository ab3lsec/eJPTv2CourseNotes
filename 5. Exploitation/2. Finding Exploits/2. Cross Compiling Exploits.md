# Cross Compiling Exploits

- In many case, exploit codes will be developed in C, C++ etc.. So in this case we need to compile the exploit shellcode into a Portable executable or Binary. 
- This process of compiling code for a platform other than the local platform is known as Cross-Compilation

For Example: Compiling a Windows exploit code in a Linux system. 

### COMPILING WINDOWS EXPLOIT IN LINUX:

###### 1. FOR 64BIT SYSTEMS:

```sh
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o xploit64
```

###### 2. FOR 32 BIT SYSTEMS:

```sh
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o xploit32 -lws2_32
```

### COMPILING LINUX EXPLOIT:

```sh
gcc -pthread 40839.c -o dirtycow -lcrypt
```
