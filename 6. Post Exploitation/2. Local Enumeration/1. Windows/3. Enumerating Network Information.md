# Enumerating Windows Network Information

In this section we'll be looking for network info. This info will be important for the pivoting phase. The info that we're looking for is:

- Current IP address and network adapter.
- Internal networks.
- TCP/UDP services running and their respective ports.
- Others hosts in the network.
- Routing table.
- Windows Firewall rules and state.
- Hosts file.

#### BASIC NETWORK COMMANDS:

```c
C:\> ipconfig
C:\> ipconfig /ALL
# query info on the network adapters and information like Default Gateway, IPv4 IPv6 address. Subnet Mask etc..
C:\> route print
# show routes
C:\> arp -a
# displays ARP table which lists other computers on network or subnet

C:\> type %WINDIR%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
C:\> type C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
# print the hosts file. first one is the CMD variable.
```

#### TCP/UDP SERVICES ENUMERATION:

```c
C:\> netstat -ano
# lists TCP/UDP services currently running and listening on each ports, also network connections established
```

#### FIREWALL ENUMERATION:

```c
C:\> netsh firewall show state 
# check firewall state

C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall dump fileName.wfw
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall export fileName.wfw
# get all the firewall rules. both commands do the same, but it will depend on the windows version.

C:\> netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
# check firewall state verbose
```
