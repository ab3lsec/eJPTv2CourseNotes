# Abusing SUDO Privileges

In Linux, SUDO gives permissions to a normal user to run commands as a root user.
Normally SUDO privileges are given only to users who are added in `sudoers` file.
If all the users are give SUDO privileges, then it can be dangerous!!
<br>
As an attacker, if we manage to gain a normal low privilege user shell and that user have SUDO privileges, Then we can abuse it to escalate our privileges to root!!
<br>
To check whether we have SUDO privileges we can use:

```bash
sudo -l
```

This command will list all the programs to which we have SUDO privileges.<br>

Once we identify available programs we can search it in a website called [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
<br>If we take `/usr/bin/find` program as an example, then we can search find in it and get the shell escape code under SUDO.
