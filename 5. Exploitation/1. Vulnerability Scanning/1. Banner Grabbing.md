# Vulnerability Scanning via Banner Grabbing 

Banner grabbing is a information gathering technique used by pen testers to gather information related to the Target OS and the services running on the ports and the service versions.

Banner Grabbing can be performed in following ways:
1. By running a Service detection scan on target using #nmap
2. Connecting to the port using #netcat
3. Authenticating to a target service like SSH, FTP with or without credentials.

As an attacker we can use the identified version information to search for an existing exploit using tools like #searchsploit

#### 1. SERVICE DETECTION USING NMAP

```sh
nmap -sV -T4 "TARGET IP"
```
#### 2. BANNER GRABBING USING A NMEP SCRIPT:

```sh
nmap --script banner "TARGET IP"
```
#### 3. CONNECTING TO PORT USING NETCAT

```sh
nc "TARGET IP" "SERVICE PORT"
```
#### 4. AUTHENTICATING TO TARGET SERVICE

```sh
ssh root@"TARGET IP"
```
