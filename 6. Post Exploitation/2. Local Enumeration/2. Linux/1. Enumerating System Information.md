# Enumerating Linux System Information

This involves techniques that involves finding what OS is running on the system as well as its version. This information is very helpful finding appropriate exploits that we can run against this particular target like:
- Hostname 
- Distribution or Release Version
- Kernel version & Architecture
- CPU information : Enumerate CPU cores, resource allocation etc..
- Disk Information & Mounted drives : Enumerate storage used, other drives connected etc..
- Installed Hotfixes or Updates

#### BASIC LINUX ENUMERATION:

```c
# ENUMERATE SYSTEM NAME
hostname

# ENUMERATING DISTRIBUTION  
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/release 

# ENUMERATES VALUES OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
env

# ENUMERATE INSTALLED PACKAGES
$ dpkg -l 
```
#### KERNEL ENUMERATION:

```c
# Lists detailed information about the system kernel
uname -a

# Displays the Kernel version only
uname -r
```

#### CPU AND RAM ENUMERATION:

```c
# CPU ENUMERATION LIKE CORES, L1 L2 L3 CACHE, BUILD VERSION ETC...
lscpu 
cat /proc/cpuinfo

# MEMORY/ RAM ENUMERATION
free -h 
cat /proc/meminfo
```

#### ENUMERATE FILE SYSTEM & MOUNT POINTS:

```c
df -h 
df -ht [FILESYSTEM]

$ lsblk 
cat /etc/fstab
```
