# Automating Windows Local Enumeration

As pen testers, we have to be time efficient. For that, we have the possibility to use automation tools for enumerating different information in a system. While knowing how to enumerate information manually is useful, and in some cases the only way in which we can get any information from a system, automation tools are quicker, and sometimes better.

#### WINDOWS LE USING JAWS:

[JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS) is PowerShell script designed to help penetration testers quickly identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems.


```c
meterpreter > cd C:\\
meterpreter > mkdir Temp
meterpreter > cd Temp\\
meterpreter > upload JAWS.ps1
meterpreter > shell

C:\> powershell.exe -ep bypass -f .\JAWS.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWSout.txt
```

#### WINDOWS LE USING METASPLOIT:

```c
# ENUMERATE PRIVILEGES OF CURRENT USER
use post/windows/gather/win_privs
set SESSION [SESSION_ID]

# LIST OTHER LOGGED ON USERS ON THE SYSTEM
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
set SESSION [SESSION_ID]

# CHECKING WHETHER THE TARGET IS IN A VM
use post/windows/gather/checkvm
set SESSION [SESSION_ID]

# ENUMERATE PROGRAMS OR APPS INSTALLED ON THE TARGET
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
set SESSION [SESSION_ID]

# ENUMERATE OTHER COMPUTERS ON THE SYSTEM
use post/windows/gather/enum_computers
set SESSION [SESSION_ID]

# ENUMERATE INSTALLED PATCHES OR HOTIXES
use post/windows/gather/enum_patches
