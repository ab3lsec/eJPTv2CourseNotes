# Black Box Pentest on Windows
A black box penetration testing is a security assessment where the penetration tester is not provided any information about the target system like IP ranges, System Information or default credentials.

This exactly demonstrates how an external hacker on an adversary will attack the system without knowing anything about the systems in the network.

#### BLACK BOX METHODOLOGY:

1. Host Discovery
2. Port Scanning and Enumeration
3. Vulnerability Detection
4. Exploitation (Manual and Automated)
5. Post Exploitation (PrivEsc, Persistence Pivoting, Hash Dump)
