# Port Scanning with Auxiliary Modules
#### WHY NOT NMAP?
Because if you exploit a system on one subnet and that system is a part of internal network or private subnet so because of this many systems can be present in that new subnet, this basically expands our attack surface <br>
In this case we cannot use NMAP because we don't know the IP address of the systems of the new private subnet.

###### INITIAL TCP PORT SCAN:

```sh
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <TARGET IP>
exploit
```

##### POST EXPLOITATION SCAN:

1. Spawn a shell and check the IP configuration using `ifconfig`
2. Download the Route configuration on the target.
```sh
run autoroute -s "SECOND SUBNET IP"
```
3. Background the current Meterpreter session.
4. Do the Initial TCP scan on the new Subnet.

##### UDP PORT SCAN:

```sh
use auxiliary/scanner/discover/udp_sweep
set RHOSTS <TARGET IP>
exploit
```
