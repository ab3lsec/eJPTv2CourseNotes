# What is Post Exploitation?

- Post Exploitation is final phase of the penetration testing process that includes what you do or have to do once you gain an initial foothold on target system.
- This includes process like creating a backdoor for persistence, escalating privileges to ROOT or pivoting to other systems on the target.
- This tactics and techniques will further depend on what access you have on the target system and how stealthy you have to be.

For Example:  if you have access to a service account in Windows, you won't be able to dump credentials from the SAM database.

#### POST EXPLOITATION METHODOLOGY:

1. **Local enumeration**: process in which we gain information about a system.
2. Transferring files: process in which we upload files and binaries to a system.
3. Upgrading shells: process in which we get a better shell than we previously had.
4. Privilege escalation: process in which we elevate our privileges to SYSTEM or root privileges.
5. Persistence: process in which we can get continuous access to a system through system reboots and connection issues.
6. Dumping and cracking hashes: process in which we get plaintext credentials to further exploit a system. This stage is not only present on post-exploitation, as you might get an NTLM hash or TGS (Ticket Granting Service) from Kerberos and stole that from the network.
7. Pivoting: process in which we scan the network in which a target is located to jump and exploit other machines.
8. Clearing tracks: process in which we clear all evidence about our actions and the fact that we exploited a machine. _What? I didn't do anything! Check the logs! :)_
