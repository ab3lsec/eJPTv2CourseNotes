# HTTP Method Enumeration using CURL

When doing a web pen test, the first thing that we want to do is reconnaissance. And the first step of that recon, is getting to know which methods does the web site or app allow. Now, there are a few ways of doing this.
Nmap also has a script calledÂ `http-methods`

#### HTTP METHOD ENUMERATION USING CURL:

1. Show the Website on terminal
```
curl -v http://10.10.10.10
```

2. Enumerate Available HTTP Headers
```
curl -X OPTIONS http://10.10.10.10/uploads/
curl -X POST http://10.10.10.10/uploads/
curl -X PUT http://10.10.10.10/uploads/
```

3. Upload a File (If POST is available)
```
curl http://10.10.10.10/uploads/ --upload-file hello.txt
```

4. Delete a File (If DELETE is available)
```
curl -X DELETE http://10.10.10.10/uploads/hello.txt
```

##### HTTP METHOD ENUMERATION USING BURPSUITE:

1. Start the Proxy and turn the Intercept ON
2. Now reload the page to capture the request on Burp Suite
3. Then send it to Repeater and alter the HTTP Request header to test availability of different methods
