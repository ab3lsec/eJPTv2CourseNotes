# Information Gathering Methodology

- Find the active alive hosts on the target subnet
- First start with a NMAP scan on all ports
```sh
nmap -p- <TARGET IP>
```
- Identify all the open ports from the results.
- Then conduct a detailed scan on all open ports
```sh
nmap -sC -sV <TERGET IP> 
```
- If nothing is found, make sure to run UDP Scan
```sh
nmap -sU <TARGET IP>
```
